			<h1>Monkey D Luffy</h1>
			<p>Monkey D. "Straw Hat"[n 1] Luffy[n 2] (Japanese: モンキー・D・ルフィ Hepburn: Monkī Dī Rufi) is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the One Piece manga series created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut in One Piece chapter #1 as a young boy whose body gains the properties of rubber after he inadvertently eats the supernatural Gum-Gum Fruit.In One Piece, Luffy sails from the East Blue to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure One Piece to succeed Gol D. Roger as the King of the Pirates. He is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and along his journey, he recruits new crew members, fights several antagonists, and aids and befriends the locals of various islands. Luffy has a cheerful demeanor but is quickly serious when fighting. Luffy is able to use the elasticity of his body to concentrate his strength and power to execute a diverse range of attacks. The most prominent is his signature attack called Gum-Gum Pistol, in which Luffy slingshots his punches at opponents from a distance.As the protagonist, Luffy appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials, and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations, as well as several of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Luffy has become one of the most recognizable and iconic anime characters in the world. Outside the One Piece franchise, Luffy has had an appearance in various manga and anime series, and collaborative video games. Luffy's critical reception was largely positive.</p>

			<h1>Zoro Roronoa</h1>
			<p>Roronoa Zoro (ロロノア・ゾロ, spelled as "Roronoa Zolo" or "Roronoa Zollo" in some English adaptations), nicknamed "Pirate Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro), is a fictional character in the One Piece franchise created by Eiichiro Oda.In the story, Zoro is the first to join Monkey D. Luffy after he is saved from being executed at the Marine Base. He is one of the two swordsmen of the Straw Hat Pirates, the other being Brook.

			<h1>Nami</h1>
			<p>"Cat Burglar" Nami is a pirate and the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates. She was the third member of the crew and the second to join, doing so during the Orange Town Arc.She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the Straw Hats in order to rob them for her real crew, but joined the Straw Hats for real after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong.

			<img src="/crew/One_Piece_Usopp.jpg" alt="one piece"  class=" thumbnail pull-right" width="15%" >
			<h1>Usopp</h1>
			<p>"God" Usopp is a pirate and is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates, and the former captain of the Usopp Pirates. When Usopp was first introduced, he was often (comically) labeled as the "Liar" of the Straw Hat Pirates, due to the "Uso" (うそ) in his name meaning "lie" or "falsehood" (嘘). He was born in Syrup Village, and was first mentioned by Yasopp, his father.He was officially the third (unofficially fourth) member of the crew, and the third to join, and, including Nami and Robin, also the third to rejoin, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc. His original bounty of Beli30,000,000 was credited to his alias and alter-ego "Sogeking".During the events in Dressrosa, Usopp awakened his Kenbunshoku Haki, making him the fourth member of the Straw Hat crew to demonstrate and use a form of Haki. His current bounty, Beli200,000,000, is a huge jump from his original, due to his role as "God" for saving all the toy slaves in Doflamingo's underground trades. This takes him from the third lowest bounty of the crew to the third highest, jumping past the previous holder, Nico Robin.</p>
